These physical data model diagrams were reverse engineered from the MySQL version of the  
sakila database using the Java tool DbVisualizer: http://www.dbvis.com/

The "with-cols" (e.g., sakila-mysql-with-cols-dbvis.png) version shows all the columns, 
whereas the other file (e.g., sakila-mysql-dbvis.png) just shows the table name and
 primary key to more easily see the table relationships.
