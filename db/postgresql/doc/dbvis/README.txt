These physical data model diagrams were reverse engineered from the PostgreSQL 
version of the sakila database using the Java tool DbVisualizer: http://www.dbvis.com/

The "with-cols" (e.g., sakila-pg-with-cols-dbvis.png) version shows all the 
columns, whereas the other files just show the table name to more easily see the 
table relationships.
